## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) (recommended for managing Python environments)
- Required Python packages (install via `pip` or `conda`):
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `sklearn`
  - `statsmodels`
  - `shap`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/time-series-forecasting.git
   cd time-series-forecasting
   ```

2. Set up a Python environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   conda create -n time-series-env python=3.7
   conda activate time-series-env
   ```

3. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Data should be placed in the `data/` directory.
- Modify the model configurations and hyperparameters in the `src/model_selection/model_selector.py` file.
- Run the main script to train and evaluate models:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Models

- The project supports various models for time series forecasting, including:
  - Simple RNN
  - LSTM
  - ARIMA
  - SARIMAX
  - Random Forest Regressor

## Performance Evaluation

- Model performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and other metrics.
- Evaluation results are logged in the `logs/` directory.
- Prediction lags and autocorrelation analysis are also performed.

## Scenario Analysis

- Scenario analysis is available to simulate various scenarios (e.g., shocks) in the time series data.

## Visualization

- Visualization functions are included to plot actual vs. forecasted values and other relevant visualizations.
